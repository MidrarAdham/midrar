# This file is meant to control NHR 9410 (Grid Simulator) frequency via SCPI Commands.
# The frequency values provided here is just an example.
# An array of different values is used to accomplish this task.
# The equipment accepts values between 30-880 Hz.(Accodring to NHR 9400 Series AC/DC Power Module Programmerâ€™s Reference Manual)
# For each command below, a brief description is provided.
# This file is available to anyone who would like to use it. Feel free to copy,edit, and develop its content.

# Each command will be executed after the connection is closed. This means that for each command, we have to establish the connection, sent the command, close the connection.
# As you read through this file, you'll find flags. These flags are not important. They were used just for learning purposes.
